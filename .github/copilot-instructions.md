# Copilot Instructions

Use this repository's source-of-truth files before answering status questions.

## Read in this exact order
1. `docs/STATUS.md`
2. `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `docs/DECISIONS.md`
5. `docs/ai-context.json`

## Required behavior
- For update requests, cite the exact file paths used.
- If files conflict, prefer `docs/STATUS.md` for current state.
- If information is missing, explicitly call out which file needs updating.
